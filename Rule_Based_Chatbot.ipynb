This diversification led to it being referred to as \"The Everything Store\".[7]\\n\\nThe company has multiple subsidiaries, including Amazon Web Services, providing cloud computing, Zoox, a self-driving car division, Kuiper Systems, a satellite Internet provider, and Amazon Lab126, a computer hardware R&D provider. Other subsidiaries include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, and Whole Foods Market. Its acquisition of Whole Foods in August 2017 for US$13.4 billion substantially increased its market share and presence as a physical retailer.[8] Amazon also distributes a variety of downloadable and streaming content through its Amazon Prime Video, MGM+, Amazon Music, Twitch, Audible and Wondery[9] units. It publishes books through its publishing arm, Amazon Publishing, film and television content through Amazon MGM Studios, including the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio, which was acquired in March 2022, and owns Brilliance Audio and Audible, which produce and distribute audiobooks, respectively. Amazon also produces consumer electronics—most notably, Kindle e-readers, Echo devices, Fire tablets, and Fire TVs.\\n\\nAmazon has a reputation as a disruptor of industries through technological innovation and aggressive reinvestment of profits into capital expenditures.[10][11][12][13] As of 2023, it is the world\\'s largest online retailer and marketplace, smart speaker provider, cloud computing service through AWS,[14] live-streaming service through Twitch, and Internet company as measured by revenue and market share.[15] In 2021, it surpassed Walmart as the world\\'s largest retailer outside of China, driven in large part by its paid subscription plan, Amazon Prime, which has close to 200 million subscribers worldwide.[16][17] It is the second-largest private employer in the United States[18] and the second-largest company in the World and in the US by revenue as of 2024.[19] As of October 2023, Amazon is the 12th-most visited website in the world and 82% of its traffic comes from the United States.[20][21] Amazon is also the global leader in research and development spending, with R&D expenditure of US$73 billion in 2022.[22]\\n\\nAmazon has been criticized on various grounds, including but not limited to customer data collection practices, a toxic work culture, censorship, tax avoidance, and anti-competitive practices.\\n\\nHistory\\nMain article: History of Amazon\\n1994–2009\\n\\nJeff Bezos\\'s home in Bellevue, Washington, where the company was founded in 1994\\nAmazon was founded on July 5, 1994, by Jeff Bezos after he relocated from New York City to Bellevue, Washington, near Seattle, to operate an online bookstore. Bezos chose the Seattle area for its abundance of technical talent from Microsoft and the University of Washington, as well as its smaller population for sales tax purposes and the proximity to a major book distribution warehouse in Roseburg, Oregon. Bezos also considered several other options, including Portland, Oregon, and Boulder, Colorado.[23] The company, originally named Cadabra, was founded in the converted garage of Bezos\\'s house for symbolic reasons and was renamed to Amazon in November 1994.[24] The Amazon website launched for public sales on July 16, 1995, and initially sourced its books directly from wholesalers and publishers.[23][25]\\n\\nAmazon went public in May 1997. It began selling music and videos in 1998, and began international operations by acquiring online sellers of books in the United Kingdom and Germany. In the subsequent year, it initiated the sale of a diverse range of products, including music, video games, consumer electronics, home improvement items, software, games, and toys.[26][27]\\n\\nIn 2002, it launched Amazon Web Services (AWS), which initially focused on providing APIs for web developers to build web applications on top of Amazon\\'s ecommerce platform.[28][29] In 2004, AWS was expanded to provide website popularity statistics and web crawler data from the Alexa Web Information Service.[30] AWS later shifted toward providing enterprise services with Simple Storage Service (S3) in 2006,[31] and Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) in 2008,[32] allowing companies to rent data storage and computing power from Amazon. In 2006, Amazon also launched the Fulfillment by Amazon program, which allowed individuals and small companies (called \"third-party sellers\") to sell products through Amazon\\'s warehouses and fulfillment infrastructure.[33]\\n\\n2010–present\\nAmazon purchased the Whole Foods Market supermarket chain in 2017.[34] It is the leading e-retailer in the United States with approximately US$178 billion net sales in 2017. It has over 300 million active customer accounts globally.[35]\\n\\nAmazon saw large growth during the COVID-19 pandemic, hiring more than 100,000 staff in the United States and Canada.[36] Some Amazon workers in the US, France, and Italy protested the company\\'s decision to \"run normal shifts\" due to COVID-19\\'s ease of spread in warehouses.[37][38] In Spain, the company faced legal complaints over its policies,[39] while a group of US Senators wrote an open letter to Bezos expressing concerns about workplace safety.[40]\\n\\nOn February 2, 2021, Bezos announced that he would step down as CEO to become executive chair of Amazon\\'s board. The transition officially took place on July 5, 2021, with former CEO of AWS Andy Jassy replacing him as CEO.[41][42] In January 2023, Amazon cut over 18,000 jobs, primarily in consumer retail and its human resources division in an attempt to cut costs.[43]\\n\\nOn November 8, 2023, a plan was adopted for Jeff Bezos to sell approximately 50 million shares of the company over the next year (the deadline for the entire sales plan is January 31, 2025). The first step was the sale of 12 million shares for about $2 billion.[44]\\n\\nProducts and services\\nMain article: List of Amazon products and services\\nAmazon.com\\namazon.com\\n\\nLogo since January 2000\\nScreenshot\\nType of site\\tE-commerce\\nAvailable in\\t\\nArabicChineseDutchEnglishFrenchGermanHindiItalianJapanesePolishPortugueseSpanishSwedishTurkish\\nOwner\\tAmazon\\nURL\\tamazon.com (original US site)\\nCommercial\\tYes\\nRegistration\\tOptional\\nLaunched\\t1995; 29 years ago\\nCurrent status\\tActive\\nWritten in\\tC++ and Java\\n[45]\\nAmazon.com is an e-commerce platform that sells many product lines, including media (books, movies, music, and software), apparel, baby products, consumer electronics, beauty products, gourmet food, groceries, health and personal care products, industrial & scientific supplies, kitchen items, jewelry, watches, lawn and garden items, musical instruments, sporting goods, tools, automotive items, toys and games, and farm supplies[46] and consulting services.[47] Amazon websites are country-specific (for example, amazon.com for the US and amazon.co.uk for UK) though some offer international shipping.[48]\\n\\nVisits to amazon.com grew from 615 million annual visitors in 2008,[49] to more than 2 billion per month in 2022.[citation needed] The e-commerce platform is the 14th most visited website in the world.[50]\\n\\nResults generated by Amazon\\'s search engine are partly determined by promotional fees.[51] The company\\'s localized storefronts, which differ in selection and prices, are differentiated by top-level domain and country code:\\n\\n\\nAmazon Marketplaces worldwide\\n  Top-Level Domain\\n  Served by neighboring Domain\\n  Confirmed launch, currently served by neighboring domain\\nSales by country (2023)[52]\\nCountry\\tshare\\nUnited States\\t69.3%\\nGermany\\t6.5%\\nUnited Kingdom\\t5.8%\\nJapan\\t4.8%\\nOther\\t13.6%\\nRegion\\tCountry\\tDomain name\\tSince\\tLanguages\\tNotes\\nAfrica\\tEgypt\\tamazon.eg\\tSeptember 2021\\tArabic, English\\tFormerly known as Souq.com Egypt\\nSouth Africa\\tamazon.co.za\\tMay 2024\\tEnglish\\t\\nAmericas\\tBrazil\\tamazon.com.br\\tDecember 2012\\tPortuguese\\t\\nCanada\\tamazon.ca\\tJune 2002\\tEnglish, French\\t\\nMexico\\tamazon.com.mx\\tAugust 2013\\tSpanish\\t\\nUnited States\\tamazon.com\\tJuly 1995\\tEnglish, Spanish, Arabic, German, Hebrew, Korean, Portuguese, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional)\\tInternational customers without a localized Amazon website may purchase eBooks from the Kindle Store on Amazon US.[53]\\nAsia\\tChina\\tamazon.cn\\tSeptember 2004\\tChinese (Simplified)\\tFormerly known as Joyo.com CHN\\nIndia\\tamazon.in\\tJune 2013\\tEnglish, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Bengali, Marathi\\t\\nJapan\\tamazon.co.jp\\tNovember 2000\\tJapanese, English, Chinese (Simplified)\\t\\nSaudi Arabia\\tamazon.sa\\tJune 2020\\tArabic, English\\tFormerly known as Souq.com KSA\\nSingapore\\tamazon.sg\\tJuly 2017\\tEnglish\\t\\nTurkey\\tamazon.com.tr\\tSeptember 2018\\tTurkish\\t\\nUnited Arab Emirates\\tamazon.ae\\tMay 2019\\tArabic, English\\tFormerly known as Souq.com UAE\\nEurope\\tBelgium\\tamazon.com.be\\tOctober 2022\\tDutch, French, English\\t\\nFrance\\tamazon.fr\\tAugust 2000\\tFrench, English\\t\\nGermany\\tamazon.de\\tOctober 1998\\tGerman, English, Czech, Dutch, Polish, Turkish\\tAlso serves Austria,[54] Denmark[55] and Switzerland[56]\\nItaly\\tamazon.it\\tNovember 2010\\tItalian, English\\t\\nNetherlands\\tamazon.nl\\tNovember 2014\\tDutch, English\\tInitially only books & e-books, full shop opened March 2020[57]\\nPoland\\tamazon.pl\\tMarch 2021\\tPolish\\t\\nSpain\\tamazon.es\\tSeptember 2011\\tSpanish, Portuguese\\tAlso serves Portugal[58]\\nSweden\\tamazon.se\\tOctober 2020\\tSwedish, English\\t\\nUnited Kingdom\\tamazon.co.uk\\tOctober 1998\\tEnglish\\tAlso serves Ireland[59]\\nOceania\\tAustralia\\tamazon.com.au\\tNovember 2017\\tEnglish\\tAlso serves New Zealand[60]\\nConfirmed launch\\nEurope\\tIreland\\tamazon.ie\\t2025[61]\\tEnglish\\tCurrently served by amazon.co.uk\\nMerchant partnerships\\nIn 2000, US toy retailer Toys \"R\" Us entered into a 10-year agreement with Amazon, valued at $50 million per year plus a cut of sales, under which Toys \"R\" Us would be the exclusive supplier of toys and baby products on the service, and the chain\\'s website would redirect to Amazon\\'s Toys & Games category. In 2004, Toys \"R\" Us sued Amazon, claiming that because of a perceived lack of variety in Toys \"R\" Us stock, Amazon had knowingly allowed third-party sellers to offer items on the service in categories that Toys \"R\" Us had been granted exclusivity. In 2006, a court ruled in favor of Toys \"R\" Us, giving it the right to unwind its agreement with Amazon and establish its independent e-commerce website. The company was later awarded $51 million in damages.[62][63][64]\\n\\nIn 2001, Amazon entered into a similar agreement with Borders Group, under which Amazon would comanage Borders.com as a co-branded service.[65] Borders pulled out of the arrangement in 2007, with plans to also launch its own online store.[66]\\n\\nOn October 18, 2011, Amazon.com announced a partnership with DC Comics for the exclusive digital rights to many popular comics, including Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, The Sandman, and Watchmen. The partnership has caused well-known bookstores like Barnes & Noble to remove these titles from their shelves.[67]\\n\\nIn November 2013, Amazon announced a partnership with the United States Postal Service to begin delivering orders on Sundays. The service, included in Amazon\\'s standard shipping rates, initiated in metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and New York because of the high-volume and inability to deliver in a timely way, with plans to expand into Dallas, Houston, New Orleans and Phoenix by 2014.[68]\\n\\nIn June 2017, Nike agreed to sell products through Amazon in exchange for better policing of counterfeit goods.[69][70] This proved unsuccessful and Nike withdrew from the partnership in November 2019.[70][71] Companies including IKEA and Birkenstock also stopped selling through Amazon around the same time, citing similar frustrations over business practices and counterfeit goods.[72]\\n\\nIn September 2017, Amazon ventured with one of its sellers JV Appario Retail owned by Patni Group which has recorded a total income of US$\\u2009104.44\\u2009million (₹759 crore) in financial year 2017–2018.[73]\\n\\nAs of October 11, 2017, AmazonFresh sold a range of Booths branded products for home delivery in selected areas.[74]\\n\\nIn November 2018, Amazon reached an agreement with Apple Inc. to sell selected products through the service, via the company and selected Apple Authorized Resellers. As a result of this partnership, only Apple Authorized Resellers may sell Apple products on Amazon effective January 4, 2019.[75][76]\\n\\nPrivate-label products\\nMain article: List of Amazon brands\\nAmazon sells many products under its own brand names, including phone chargers, batteries, and diaper wipes. The AmazonBasics brand was introduced in 2009, and now features hundreds of product lines, including smartphone cases, computer mice, batteries, dumbbells, and dog crates. Amazon owned 34 private-label brands as of 2019. These brands account for 0.15% of Amazon\\'s global sales, whereas the average for other large retailers is 18%.[77] Other Amazon retail brands include Presto!, Mama Bear, and Amazon Essentials.[78]\\n\\nThird-party sellers\\nAmazon derives many of its sales (around 40% in 2008) from third-party sellers who sell products on Amazon.[79] Some other large e-commerce sellers use Amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their websites. The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers. Small sellers of used and new goods go to Amazon Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price.[80]\\n\\nAffiliate program\\nPublishers can sign up as affiliates and receive a commission for referring customers to Amazon by placing links to Amazon on their websites if the referral results in a sale. Worldwide, Amazon has \"over 900,000 members\" in its affiliate programs.[81] In the middle of 2014, the Amazon Affiliate Program is used by 1.2% of all websites and it is the second most popular advertising network after Google Ads.[82] It is frequently used by websites and non-profits to provide a way for supporters to earn them a commission.[83]\\n\\nAssociates can access the Amazon catalog directly on their websites by using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) XML service. A new affiliate product, aStore, allows Associates to embed a subset of Amazon products within another website, or linked to another website. In June 2010, Amazon Seller Product Suggestions was launched to provide more transparency to sellers by recommending specific products to third-party sellers to sell on Amazon. Products suggested are based on customers\\' browsing history.[84]\\n\\nProduct reviews\\nSee also: Criticism of Amazon § Amazon reviews\\nAmazon allows users to submit reviews to the web page of each product. Reviewers must rate the product on a rating scale from one to five stars. Amazon provides a badging option for reviewers which indicates the real name of the reviewer (based on confirmation of a credit card account) or which indicates that the reviewer is one of the top reviewers by popularity. As of December 16, 2020, Amazon removed the ability of sellers and customers to comment on product reviews and purged their websites of all posted product review comments. In an email to sellers Amazon gave its rationale for removing this feature: \"... the comments feature on customer reviews was rarely used.\" The remaining review response options are to indicate whether the reader finds the review helpful or to report that it violates Amazon policies (abuse). If a review is given enough \"helpful\" hits, it appears on the front page of the product. In 2010, Amazon was reported as being the largest single source of Internet consumer reviews.[85]\\n\\nWhen publishers asked Bezos why Amazon would publish negative reviews, he defended the practice by claiming that Amazon.com was \"taking a different approach ... we want to make every book available—the good, the bad and the ugly ... to let truth loose\".[86]\\n\\nThere have been cases of positive reviews being written and posted by public relations companies on behalf of their clients[87] and instances of writers using pseudonyms to leave negative reviews of their rivals\\' works.\\n\\nAmazon sales rank\\nThe Amazon sales rank (ASR) indicates the popularity of a product sold on any Amazon locale. It is a relative indicator of popularity that is updated hourly. Effectively, it is a \"best sellers list\" for the millions of products stocked by Amazon.[88] While the ASR has no direct effect on the sales of a product, it is used by Amazon to determine which products to include in its bestsellers lists.[88] Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website and this may lead to an increase in sales. In particular, products that experience large jumps (up or down) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon\\'s lists of \"movers and shakers\"; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales.[89] For competitive reasons, Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public. However, Amazon has now begun to release point of sale data via the Nielsen BookScan service to verified authors.[90] While the ASR has been the source of much speculation by publishers, manufacturers, and marketers, Amazon itself does not release the details of its sales rank calculation algorithm. Some companies have analyzed Amazon sales data to generate sales estimates based on the ASR,[91] though Amazon states:\\n\\nPlease keep in mind that our sales rank figures are simply meant to be a guide of general interest for the customer and not definitive sales information for publishers—we assume you have this information regularly from your distribution sources\\n\\n—\\u200aAmazon.com Help[92]\\nPhysical stores\\nIn November 2015, Amazon opened a physical Amazon Books store in University Village in Seattle. The store was 5,500 square feet and prices for all products match those on its website.[93] Amazon opened its tenth physical book store in 2017;[94] media speculation at the time suggested that Amazon planned to eventually roll out 300 to 400 bookstores around the country.[93] All of its locations were closed in 2022 along with other retail locations under the \"Amazon 4-Star\" brand.[95]\\n\\nIn July 2016, the company announced that it was opening a 1,100,000 ft (335,280.0 m) square foot facility in Palmer Township in the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania. As of 2024, Amazon is Lehigh Valley region\\'s third-largest employer.[96][97]\\n\\nIn August 2019, Amazon applied to have a liquor store in San Francisco, as a means to ship beer and alcohol within the city.[98]\\n\\nIn 2020, Amazon Fresh opened several physical stores in the U.S. and the United Kingdom.[99]\\n\\nHardware and services\\nAmazon has a number of products and services available, including its digital assistant Alexa, Amazon Music, and Prime Video for music and videos respectively, the Amazon Appstore for Android apps, the Kindle line of eink e-readers, Fire and Fire HD color LCD tablets. Audible provides audiobooks for purchase and listening.\\n\\nIn September 2021, Amazon announced the launch of Astro, its first household robot, powered by its Alexa smart home technology. This can be remote-controlled when not at home, to check on pets, people, or home security. It will send owners a notification if it detects something unusual.[100]\\n\\nIn January 2023, Amazon announced the launch of RXPass, a prescription drug delivery service. It allows U.S. Amazon Prime members to pay a $5 monthly fee for access to 60 medications. The service was launched immediately after the announcement except in states with specific prescription delivery requirements. Beneficiaries of government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid will not be able to sign up for RXPass.[101]\\n\\nSubsidiaries\\nSee also: List of mergers and acquisitions by Amazon\\nAmazon owns over 100 subsidiaries, including Amazon Web Services, Audible, Diapers.com, Goodreads, IMDb, Kiva Systems (now Amazon Robotics), One Medical, Shopbop, Teachstreet, Twitch, Zappos, and Zoox.[102]\\n\\nBezos separately owns The Washington Post (through Nash Holdings, LLC), Blue Origin, Bezos Expeditions, Altos Labs, and other companies.\\n\\nAmazon Web Services\\nMain article: Amazon Web Services\\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. These cloud computing web services provide distributed computing processing capacity and software tools via AWS server farms. As of 2021 Q4, AWS has 33% market share for cloud infrastructure while the next two competitors Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud have 21%, and 10% respectively, according to Synergy Group.[103]\\n\\nAudible\\nMain article: Audible (service)\\nAudible is a seller and producer of spoken audio entertainment, information, and educational programming on the Internet. Audible sells digital audiobooks, radio and television programs, and audio versions of magazines and newspapers.

There are 75 fulfillment centers and 25 sortation centers with over 125,000 employees.[150][151] Employees are responsible for five basic tasks: unpacking and inspecting incoming goods; placing goods in storage and recording their location; picking goods from their computer recorded locations to make up an individual shipment; sorting and packing orders; and shipping. A computer that records the location of goods and maps out routes for pickers plays a key role: employees carry hand-held computers which communicate with the central computer and monitor their rate of progress.

He also read many emails addressed by customers to his public email address.[178] One of Bezos\\'s most well-known internal memos was his mandate for \"all teams\" to \"expose their data and functionality\" through service interfaces \"designed from the ground up to be externalizable\". This process, commonly known as a service-oriented architecture (SOA), resulted in mandatory dogfooding of services that would later be commercialized as part of AWS.[citation needed]\\n\\nLobbying\\nAmazon lobbies the United States federal government and state governments on multiple issues such as the enforcement of sales taxes on online sales, transportation safety, privacy and data protection and intellectual property. According to regulatory filings, Amazon.com focuses its lobbying on the United States Congress, the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Reserve. Amazon.com spent roughly $3.5 million, $5 million and $9.5 million on lobbying, in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.[179] In 2019, it spent $16.8 million and had a team of 104 lobbyists.[180]\\n\\nAmazon.com was a corporate member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) until it dropped membership following protests at its shareholders\\' meeting on May 24, 2012.[181]\\n\\nIn 2014, Amazon expanded its lobbying practices as it prepared to lobby the Federal Aviation Administration to approve its drone delivery program, hiring the Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld lobbying firm in June.[182] Amazon and its lobbyists have visited with Federal Aviation Administration officials and aviation committees in Washington, D.C. to explain its plans to deliver packages.[183] In September 2020 this moved one step closer with the granting of a critical certificate by the FAA.[184]\\n\\nCriticism\\nMain article: Criticism of Amazon\\n\\nA sticker expressing an anti-Amazon message is pictured on the back of a street sign in Seattle.\\nAmazon has attracted criticism for its actions, including: supplying law enforcement with facial recognition surveillance tools;[185] forming cloud computing partnerships with the CIA;[186] leading customers away from bookshops;[187] adversely impacting the environment;[188] placing a low priority on warehouse conditions for workers;[189] actively opposing unionization efforts;[190] remotely deleting content purchased by Amazon Kindle users; taking public subsidies; seeking to patent its 1-Click technology; engaging in anti-competitive actions and price discrimination;[191][192] and reclassifying LGBT books as adult content.[193][194] Criticism has also concerned various decisions over whether to censor or publish content such as the WikiLeaks website, works containing libel, anti-LGBT merchandise, and material facilitating dogfight, cockfight, or pedophile activities. An article published by Time in the wake of social media website Parler\\'s termination of service by Amazon Web Service highlights the power companies like Amazon now have over the internet.[195] In December 2011, Amazon faced a backlash from small businesses for running a one-day deal to promote its new Price Check app. Shoppers who used the app to check prices in a brick-and-mortar store were offered a 5% discount to purchase the same item from Amazon.[196] Companies like Groupon, eBay and Taap have countered Amazon\\'s promotion by offering $10 off from their products.[197][198]\\n\\nThe company has also faced accusations of putting undue pressure on suppliers to maintain and extend its profitability. One effort to squeeze the most vulnerable book publishers was known within the company as the Gazelle Project, after Bezos suggested, according to Brad Stone, \"that Amazon should approach these small publishers the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle.\"[51] In July 2014, the Federal Trade Commission launched a lawsuit against the company alleging it was promoting in-app purchases to children, which were being transacted without parental consent.[199] In 2019, Amazon banned selling skin-lightening products after pushback from Minnesota health and environmental activists.[200] In 2022, a lawsuit filed by state attorney-general Letitia James was dismissed by the New York state court of appeals.[201] After the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon faced criticism for complying, under pressure from the Biden Administration, to \"reduce the visibility” of books critical of the COVID-19 vaccine,[202][203] which was revealed after Rep. Jim Jordan (acting on behalf of the House Judiciary Committee) subpoenaed emails between the company and the Biden Administration.[204]\\n\\nJane Friedman[205] discovered six listings of books fraudulently using her name, on Amazon and Goodreads. Amazon and Goodreads resisted removing the fraudulent titles until the author\\'s complaints went viral on social media, in a blog post titled \"I Would Rather See My Books Get Pirated Than This (Or: Why Goodreads and Amazon Are Becoming Dumpster Fires).\"[206][207][208][209]\\n\\nIn 2024, following years of criticism for providing law enforcement footage in the custody of Ring (a home security company owned by Amazon) without a warrant, Ring has halted this practice.[210] It received cautious praise from privacy-focused organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation for this change.[210]\\n\\nSee also\\nicon\\tInternet portal\\n\\tCompanies portal\\nAmazon Breakthrough Novel Award\\nAmazon Pay\\nAmazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN)\\nAmazon Storywriter\\nCamelcamelcamel – a website that tracks the prices of products sold on Amazon.com\\nHistory of Amazon\\nInternal carbon pricing\\nList of book distributors\\nStatistically improbable phrases – Amazon.com\\'s phrase extraction technique for indexing books\\nReferences\\n \"Amazon.com, Inc. 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report\".

This diversification led to it being referred to as \"The Everything Store\".[7]\\n\\nThe company has multiple subsidiaries, including Amazon Web Services, providing cloud computing, Zoox, a self-driving car division, Kuiper Systems, a satellite Internet provider, and Amazon Lab126, a computer hardware R&D provider. Other subsidiaries include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, and Whole Foods Market. Its acquisition of Whole Foods in August 2017 for US$13.4 billion substantially increased its market share and presence as a physical retailer.[8] Amazon also distributes a variety of downloadable and streaming content through its Amazon Prime Video, MGM+, Amazon Music, Twitch, Audible and Wondery[9] units. It publishes books through its publishing arm, Amazon Publishing, film and television content through Amazon MGM Studios, including the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio, which was acquired in March 2022, and owns Brilliance Audio and Audible, which produce and distribute audiobooks, respectively. Amazon also produces consumer electronics—most notably, Kindle e-readers, Echo devices, Fire tablets, and Fire TVs.\\n\\nAmazon has a reputation as a disruptor of industries through technological innovation and aggressive reinvestment of profits into capital expenditures.[10][11][12][13] As of 2023, it is the world\\'s largest online retailer and marketplace, smart speaker provider, cloud computing service through AWS,[14] live-streaming service through Twitch, and Internet company as measured by revenue and market share.[15] In 2021, it surpassed Walmart as the world\\'s largest retailer outside of China, driven in large part by its paid subscription plan, Amazon Prime, which has close to 200 million subscribers worldwide.[16][17] It is the second-largest private employer in the United States[18] and the second-largest company in the World and in the US by revenue as of 2024.[19] As of October 2023, Amazon is the 12th-most visited website in the world and 82% of its traffic comes from the United States.[20][21] Amazon is also the global leader in research and development spending, with R&D expenditure of US$73 billion in 2022.[22]\\n\\nAmazon has been criticized on various grounds, including but not limited to customer data collection practices, a toxic work culture, censorship, tax avoidance, and anti-competitive practices.\\n\\nHistory\\nMain article: History of Amazon\\n1994–2009\\n\\nJeff Bezos\\'s home in Bellevue, Washington, where the company was founded in 1994\\nAmazon was founded on July 5, 1994, by Jeff Bezos after he relocated from New York City to Bellevue, Washington, near Seattle, to operate an online bookstore. Bezos chose the Seattle area for its abundance of technical talent from Microsoft and the University of Washington, as well as its smaller population for sales tax purposes and the proximity to a major book distribution warehouse in Roseburg, Oregon. Bezos also considered several other options, including Portland, Oregon, and Boulder, Colorado.[23] The company, originally named Cadabra, was founded in the converted garage of Bezos\\'s house for symbolic reasons and was renamed to Amazon in November 1994.[24] The Amazon website launched for public sales on July 16, 1995, and initially sourced its books directly from wholesalers and publishers.[23][25]\\n\\nAmazon went public in May 1997. It began selling music and videos in 1998, and began international operations by acquiring online sellers of books in the United Kingdom and Germany. In the subsequent year, it initiated the sale of a diverse range of products, including music, video games, consumer electronics, home improvement items, software, games, and toys.[26][27]\\n\\nIn 2002, it launched Amazon Web Services (AWS), which initially focused on providing APIs for web developers to build web applications on top of Amazon\\'s ecommerce platform.[28][29] In 2004, AWS was expanded to provide website popularity statistics and web crawler data from the Alexa Web Information Service.[30] AWS later shifted toward providing enterprise services with Simple Storage Service (S3) in 2006,[31] and Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) in 2008,[32] allowing companies to rent data storage and computing power from Amazon. In 2006, Amazon also launched the Fulfillment by Amazon program, which allowed individuals and small companies (called \"third-party sellers\") to sell products through Amazon\\'s warehouses and fulfillment infrastructure.[33]\\n\\n2010–present\\nAmazon purchased the Whole Foods Market supermarket chain in 2017.[34] It is the leading e-retailer in the United States with approximately US$178 billion net sales in 2017. It has over 300 million active customer accounts globally.[35]\\n\\nAmazon saw large growth during the COVID-19 pandemic, hiring more than 100,000 staff in the United States and Canada.[36] Some Amazon workers in the US, France, and Italy protested the company\\'s decision to \"run normal shifts\" due to COVID-19\\'s ease of spread in warehouses.[37][38] In Spain, the company faced legal complaints over its policies,[39] while a group of US Senators wrote an open letter to Bezos expressing concerns about workplace safety.[40]\\n\\nOn February 2, 2021, Bezos announced that he would step down as CEO to become executive chair of Amazon\\'s board. The transition officially took place on July 5, 2021, with former CEO of AWS Andy Jassy replacing him as CEO.[41][42] In January 2023, Amazon cut over 18,000 jobs, primarily in consumer retail and its human resources division in an attempt to cut costs.[43]\\n\\nOn November 8, 2023, a plan was adopted for Jeff Bezos to sell approximately 50 million shares of the company over the next year (the deadline for the entire sales plan is January 31, 2025). The first step was the sale of 12 million shares for about $2 billion.[44]\\n\\nProducts and services\\nMain article: List of Amazon products and services\\nAmazon.com\\namazon.com\\n\\nLogo since January 2000\\nScreenshot\\nType of site\\tE-commerce\\nAvailable in\\t\\nArabicChineseDutchEnglishFrenchGermanHindiItalianJapanesePolishPortugueseSpanishSwedishTurkish\\nOwner\\tAmazon\\nURL\\tamazon.com (original US site)\\nCommercial\\tYes\\nRegistration\\tOptional\\nLaunched\\t1995; 29 years ago\\nCurrent status\\tActive\\nWritten in\\tC++ and Java\\n[45]\\nAmazon.com is an e-commerce platform that sells many product lines, including media (books, movies, music, and software), apparel, baby products, consumer electronics, beauty products, gourmet food, groceries, health and personal care products, industrial & scientific supplies, kitchen items, jewelry, watches, lawn and garden items, musical instruments, sporting goods, tools, automotive items, toys and games, and farm supplies[46] and consulting services.[47] Amazon websites are country-specific (for example, amazon.com for the US and amazon.co.uk for UK) though some offer international shipping.[48]\\n\\nVisits to amazon.com grew from 615 million annual visitors in 2008,[49] to more than 2 billion per month in 2022.[citation needed] The e-commerce platform is the 14th most visited website in the world.[50]\\n\\nResults generated by Amazon\\'s search engine are partly determined by promotional fees.[51] The company\\'s localized storefronts, which differ in selection and prices, are differentiated by top-level domain and country code:\\n\\n\\nAmazon Marketplaces worldwide\\n  Top-Level Domain\\n  Served by neighboring Domain\\n  Confirmed launch, currently served by neighboring domain\\nSales by country (2023)[52]\\nCountry\\tshare\\nUnited States\\t69.3%\\nGermany\\t6.5%\\nUnited Kingdom\\t5.8%\\nJapan\\t4.8%\\nOther\\t13.6%\\nRegion\\tCountry\\tDomain name\\tSince\\tLanguages\\tNotes\\nAfrica\\tEgypt\\tamazon.eg\\tSeptember 2021\\tArabic, English\\tFormerly known as Souq.com Egypt\\nSouth Africa\\tamazon.co.za\\tMay 2024\\tEnglish\\t\\nAmericas\\tBrazil\\tamazon.com.br\\tDecember 2012\\tPortuguese\\t\\nCanada\\tamazon.ca\\tJune 2002\\tEnglish, French\\t\\nMexico\\tamazon.com.mx\\tAugust 2013\\tSpanish\\t\\nUnited States\\tamazon.com\\tJuly 1995\\tEnglish, Spanish, Arabic, German, Hebrew, Korean, Portuguese, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional)\\tInternational customers without a localized Amazon website may purchase eBooks from the Kindle Store on Amazon US.[53]\\nAsia\\tChina\\tamazon.cn\\tSeptember 2004\\tChinese (Simplified)\\tFormerly known as Joyo.com CHN\\nIndia\\tamazon.in\\tJune 2013\\tEnglish, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Bengali, Marathi\\t\\nJapan\\tamazon.co.jp\\tNovember 2000\\tJapanese, English, Chinese (Simplified)\\t\\nSaudi Arabia\\tamazon.sa\\tJune 2020\\tArabic, English\\tFormerly known as Souq.com KSA\\nSingapore\\tamazon.sg\\tJuly 2017\\tEnglish\\t\\nTurkey\\tamazon.com.tr\\tSeptember 2018\\tTurkish\\t\\nUnited Arab Emirates\\tamazon.ae\\tMay 2019\\tArabic, English\\tFormerly known as Souq.com UAE\\nEurope\\tBelgium\\tamazon.com.be\\tOctober 2022\\tDutch, French, English\\t\\nFrance\\tamazon.fr\\tAugust 2000\\tFrench, English\\t\\nGermany\\tamazon.de\\tOctober 1998\\tGerman, English, Czech, Dutch, Polish, Turkish\\tAlso serves Austria,[54] Denmark[55] and Switzerland[56]\\nItaly\\tamazon.it\\tNovember 2010\\tItalian, English\\t\\nNetherlands\\tamazon.nl\\tNovember 2014\\tDutch, English\\tInitially only books & e-books, full shop opened March 2020[57]\\nPoland\\tamazon.pl\\tMarch 2021\\tPolish\\t\\nSpain\\tamazon.es\\tSeptember 2011\\tSpanish, Portuguese\\tAlso serves Portugal[58]\\nSweden\\tamazon.se\\tOctober 2020\\tSwedish, English\\t\\nUnited Kingdom\\tamazon.co.uk\\tOctober 1998\\tEnglish\\tAlso serves Ireland[59]\\nOceania\\tAustralia\\tamazon.com.au\\tNovember 2017\\tEnglish\\tAlso serves New Zealand[60]\\nConfirmed launch\\nEurope\\tIreland\\tamazon.ie\\t2025[61]\\tEnglish\\tCurrently served by amazon.co.uk\\nMerchant partnerships\\nIn 2000, US toy retailer Toys \"R\" Us entered into a 10-year agreement with Amazon, valued at $50 million per year plus a cut of sales, under which Toys \"R\" Us would be the exclusive supplier of toys and baby products on the service, and the chain\\'s website would redirect to Amazon\\'s Toys & Games category. In 2004, Toys \"R\" Us sued Amazon, claiming that because of a perceived lack of variety in Toys \"R\" Us stock, Amazon had knowingly allowed third-party sellers to offer items on the service in categories that Toys \"R\" Us had been granted exclusivity. In 2006, a court ruled in favor of Toys \"R\" Us, giving it the right to unwind its agreement with Amazon and establish its independent e-commerce website. The company was later awarded $51 million in damages.[62][63][64]\\n\\nIn 2001, Amazon entered into a similar agreement with Borders Group, under which Amazon would comanage Borders.com as a co-branded service.[65] Borders pulled out of the arrangement in 2007, with plans to also launch its own online store.[66]\\n\\nOn October 18, 2011, Amazon.com announced a partnership with DC Comics for the exclusive digital rights to many popular comics, including Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, The Sandman, and Watchmen. The partnership has caused well-known bookstores like Barnes & Noble to remove these titles from their shelves.[67]\\n\\nIn November 2013, Amazon announced a partnership with the United States Postal Service to begin delivering orders on Sundays. The service, included in Amazon\\'s standard shipping rates, initiated in metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and New York because of the high-volume and inability to deliver in a timely way, with plans to expand into Dallas, Houston, New Orleans and Phoenix by 2014.[68]\\n\\nIn June 2017, Nike agreed to sell products through Amazon in exchange for better policing of counterfeit goods.[69][70] This proved unsuccessful and Nike withdrew from the partnership in November 2019.[70][71] Companies including IKEA and Birkenstock also stopped selling through Amazon around the same time, citing similar frustrations over business practices and counterfeit goods.[72]\\n\\nIn September 2017, Amazon ventured with one of its sellers JV Appario Retail owned by Patni Group which has recorded a total income of US$\\u2009104.44\\u2009million (₹759 crore) in financial year 2017–2018.[73]\\n\\nAs of October 11, 2017, AmazonFresh sold a range of Booths branded products for home delivery in selected areas.[74]\\n\\nIn November 2018, Amazon reached an agreement with Apple Inc. to sell selected products through the service, via the company and selected Apple Authorized Resellers. As a result of this partnership, only Apple Authorized Resellers may sell Apple products on Amazon effective January 4, 2019.[75][76]\\n\\nPrivate-label products\\nMain article: List of Amazon brands\\nAmazon sells many products under its own brand names, including phone chargers, batteries, and diaper wipes. The AmazonBasics brand was introduced in 2009, and now features hundreds of product lines, including smartphone cases, computer mice, batteries, dumbbells, and dog crates. Amazon owned 34 private-label brands as of 2019. These brands account for 0.15% of Amazon\\'s global sales, whereas the average for other large retailers is 18%.[77] Other Amazon retail brands include Presto!, Mama Bear, and Amazon Essentials.[78]\\n\\nThird-party sellers\\nAmazon derives many of its sales (around 40% in 2008) from third-party sellers who sell products on Amazon.[79] Some other large e-commerce sellers use Amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their websites. The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers. Small sellers of used and new goods go to Amazon Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price.[80]\\n\\nAffiliate program\\nPublishers can sign up as affiliates and receive a commission for referring customers to Amazon by placing links to Amazon on their websites if the referral results in a sale. Worldwide, Amazon has \"over 900,000 members\" in its affiliate programs.[81] In the middle of 2014, the Amazon Affiliate Program is used by 1.2% of all websites and it is the second most popular advertising network after Google Ads.[82] It is frequently used by websites and non-profits to provide a way for supporters to earn them a commission.[83]\\n\\nAssociates can access the Amazon catalog directly on their websites by using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) XML service. A new affiliate product, aStore, allows Associates to embed a subset of Amazon products within another website, or linked to another website. In June 2010, Amazon Seller Product Suggestions was launched to provide more transparency to sellers by recommending specific products to third-party sellers to sell on Amazon. Products suggested are based on customers\\' browsing history.[84]\\n\\nProduct reviews\\nSee also: Criticism of Amazon § Amazon reviews\\nAmazon allows users to submit reviews to the web page of each product. Reviewers must rate the product on a rating scale from one to five stars. Amazon provides a badging option for reviewers which indicates the real name of the reviewer (based on confirmation of a credit card account) or which indicates that the reviewer is one of the top reviewers by popularity. As of December 16, 2020, Amazon removed the ability of sellers and customers to comment on product reviews and purged their websites of all posted product review comments. In an email to sellers Amazon gave its rationale for removing this feature: \"... the comments feature on customer reviews was rarely used.\" The remaining review response options are to indicate whether the reader finds the review helpful or to report that it violates Amazon policies (abuse). If a review is given enough \"helpful\" hits, it appears on the front page of the product. In 2010, Amazon was reported as being the largest single source of Internet consumer reviews.[85]\\n\\nWhen publishers asked Bezos why Amazon would publish negative reviews, he defended the practice by claiming that Amazon.com was \"taking a different approach ... we want to make every book available—the good, the bad and the ugly ... to let truth loose\".[86]\\n\\nThere have been cases of positive reviews being written and posted by public relations companies on behalf of their clients[87] and instances of writers using pseudonyms to leave negative reviews of their rivals\\' works.\\n\\nAmazon sales rank\\nThe Amazon sales rank (ASR) indicates the popularity of a product sold on any Amazon locale. It is a relative indicator of popularity that is updated hourly. Effectively, it is a \"best sellers list\" for the millions of products stocked by Amazon.[88] While the ASR has no direct effect on the sales of a product, it is used by Amazon to determine which products to include in its bestsellers lists.[88] Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website and this may lead to an increase in sales. In particular, products that experience large jumps (up or down) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon\\'s lists of \"movers and shakers\"; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales.[89] For competitive reasons, Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public. However, Amazon has now begun to release point of sale data via the Nielsen BookScan service to verified authors.[90] While the ASR has been the source of much speculation by publishers, manufacturers, and marketers, Amazon itself does not release the details of its sales rank calculation algorithm. Some companies have analyzed Amazon sales data to generate sales estimates based on the ASR,[91] though Amazon states:\\n\\nPlease keep in mind that our sales rank figures are simply meant to be a guide of general interest for the customer and not definitive sales information for publishers—we assume you have this information regularly from your distribution sources\\n\\n—\\u200aAmazon.com Help[92]\\nPhysical stores\\nIn November 2015, Amazon opened a physical Amazon Books store in University Village in Seattle.

He also read many emails addressed by customers to his public email address.[178] One of Bezos\\'s most well-known internal memos was his mandate for \"all teams\" to \"expose their data and functionality\" through service interfaces \"designed from the ground up to be externalizable\". This process, commonly known as a service-oriented architecture (SOA), resulted in mandatory dogfooding of services that would later be commercialized as part of AWS.[citation needed]\\n\\nLobbying\\nAmazon lobbies the United States federal government and state governments on multiple issues such as the enforcement of sales taxes on online sales, transportation safety, privacy and data protection and intellectual property. According to regulatory filings, Amazon.com focuses its lobbying on the United States Congress, the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Reserve. Amazon.com spent roughly $3.5 million, $5 million and $9.5 million on lobbying, in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.[179] In 2019, it spent $16.8 million and had a team of 104 lobbyists.[180]\\n\\nAmazon.com was a corporate member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) until it dropped membership following protests at its shareholders\\' meeting on May 24, 2012.[181]\\n\\nIn 2014, Amazon expanded its lobbying practices as it prepared to lobby the Federal Aviation Administration to approve its drone delivery program, hiring the Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld lobbying firm in June.[182] Amazon and its lobbyists have visited with Federal Aviation Administration officials and aviation committees in Washington, D.C. to explain its plans to deliver packages.[183] In September 2020 this moved one step closer with the granting of a critical certificate by the FAA.[184]\\n\\nCriticism\\nMain article: Criticism of Amazon\\n\\nA sticker expressing an anti-Amazon message is pictured on the back of a street sign in Seattle.\\nAmazon has attracted criticism for its actions, including: supplying law enforcement with facial recognition surveillance tools;[185] forming cloud computing partnerships with the CIA;[186] leading customers away from bookshops;[187] adversely impacting the environment;[188] placing a low priority on warehouse conditions for workers;[189] actively opposing unionization efforts;[190] remotely deleting content purchased by Amazon Kindle users; taking public subsidies; seeking to patent its 1-Click technology; engaging in anti-competitive actions and price discrimination;[191][192] and reclassifying LGBT books as adult content.[193][194] Criticism has also concerned various decisions over whether to censor or publish content such as the WikiLeaks website, works containing libel, anti-LGBT merchandise, and material facilitating dogfight, cockfight, or pedophile activities. An article published by Time in the wake of social media website Parler\\'s termination of service by Amazon Web Service highlights the power companies like Amazon now have over the internet.[195] In December 2011, Amazon faced a backlash from small businesses for running a one-day deal to promote its new Price Check app. Shoppers who used the app to check prices in a brick-and-mortar store were offered a 5% discount to purchase the same item from Amazon.[196] Companies like Groupon, eBay and Taap have countered Amazon\\'s promotion by offering $10 off from their products.[197][198]\\n\\nThe company has also faced accusations of putting undue pressure on suppliers to maintain and extend its profitability. One effort to squeeze the most vulnerable book publishers was known within the company as the Gazelle Project, after Bezos suggested, according to Brad Stone, \"that Amazon should approach these small publishers the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle.\"[51] In July 2014, the Federal Trade Commission launched a lawsuit against the company alleging it was promoting in-app purchases to children, which were being transacted without parental consent.[199] In 2019, Amazon banned selling skin-lightening products after pushback from Minnesota health and environmental activists.[200] In 2022, a lawsuit filed by state attorney-general Letitia James was dismissed by the New York state court of appeals.[201] After the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon faced criticism for complying, under pressure from the Biden Administration, to \"reduce the visibility” of books critical of the COVID-19 vaccine,[202][203] which was revealed after Rep. Jim Jordan (acting on behalf of the House Judiciary Committee) subpoenaed emails between the company and the Biden Administration.[204]\\n\\nJane Friedman[205] discovered six listings of books fraudulently using her name, on Amazon and Goodreads.
